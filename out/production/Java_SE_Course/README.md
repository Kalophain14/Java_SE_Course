Java Beginner to advanced

🎯 Course Overview

I’m starting the Java Programming course from Udemy to build strong foundations in one of the most popular and versatile programming languages in the world. ￼

Java is widely used for mobile apps, desktop software, games, web apps, and large-scale enterprise systems, and this course will help me understand how to think and code like a professional developer.

🎯 My Learning Goals

By the end of this course, I aim to:
• Understand the basics of Java syntax and write my first Java programs like a pro. ￼
• Learn core programming concepts such as variables, loops, and control flow. ￼
• Master object-oriented ideas like classes, objects, and inheritance. ￼
• Build confidence with hands-on coding exercises and real example projects. ￼

🧠 What I’ll Be Learning

During this course, I’ll study:
• Java setup and tools
• Basic syntax and program structure
• Data types, operators, and expressions
• Control structures (if statements, loops)
• Object-oriented programming fundamentals
• Exception handling and debugging
• Working with Java libraries and collections
📅 My Plan

To stay consistent and make progress:
• I’ll schedule regular study sessions each week.
• I’ll practice with code challenges after each lesson.
• I’ll revisit and revise topics that are challenging.
• I’ll try building small projects to reinforce skills.
