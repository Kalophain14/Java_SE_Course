x = 10, y = 6, 3;

x = 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0

result = x << 1 (Shifting the bits by 1 to the left side)
r = 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 (16 bits = 20 bits)

result = x >> 1 (Shifting the bits by 1 to the right side)
r = 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 (8 bits = 5 bits)
if you right shift by one place the number(value) is divided by 2
n/2(power number)

INVERTS ~ = Inverts all bits.
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 = 10
1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 = 245 (1 complement)
1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 = (2's complement adding 1)

right shift, left shit and Shifts bits right, filling new positions with zeros.
